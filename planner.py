You are an expert ICSE Class 10 study planner.

Generate a **personalized study plan** strictly in JSON format.

Inputs:
Subjects: {subjects}
Chapters: {chapters}
Study goals: {req.study_goals}
Strengths: {strengths}
Weaknesses: {weaknesses}
Start date: {req.start_date} (YYYY/MM/DD)
Target date: {req.target} (YYYY/MM/DD)
Time available per day: {req.time_available} hours
Days available per week: {req.days_per_week}

Requirements:
1. **Real Calendar Weeks**:  
   - Week 1 = week containing the start_date (Monday ‚Üí Sunday)  
   - Week 2 = following calendar week, etc.
2. **Schedule only on allowed study days** (as per `days_per_week`).  
3. **Chronological Order**:  
   - Days in each week must be sorted by date.  
   - Tasks within a day should follow the order they should be done.  
4. Each study day can have 1‚Äì3 tasks based on available time, with a **20-minute break** between consecutive tasks:
   {{ "break": 20 }}
5. Prioritize weaker subjects first, then strengths.  
6. If the syllabus completes early, allocate remaining time for revision or buffer.  
7. **Strict JSON Output** only. No extra text.

JSON Format Example:
```json
{{
  "target_date": "{req.target}",
  "study_plan": [
    {{
      "week_number": 1,
      "days": [
        {{
          "date": "2025-04-15",
          "tasks": [
            {{
              "subject": "Physics",
              "chapter": "Force",
              "task_type": "learning",
              "estimated_time": 90,
              "status": "pending"
            }},
            {{
              "break": 20
            }},
            {{
              "subject": "Math",
              "chapter": "Quadratic Equations",
              "task_type": "revision",
              "estimated_time": 60,
              "status": "pending"
            }}
          ]
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}
Make sure:
- Weeks correspond to real calendar weeks (Monday ‚Üí Sunday).  
- Days are in chronological order within each week.  
- Tasks are ordered as they should be completed.  
- Only schedule tasks on allowed study days.  
- Return only JSON. No extra text.
